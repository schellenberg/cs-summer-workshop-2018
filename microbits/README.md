# Micro:bit Session

[Presentation Slides](https://cs20.ca/Python/Functions/MicrobitReactionGame.html) give links to all of the resources we will be using. Thse are all from the Saskatchewan CS20 Open Textbook.

You will find a bitio.hex file in this folder (which is also available from the textbook). We will use a file like this to flash the Micro:bit prior to running our programs in Thonny.
